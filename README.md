**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**


To reach more customers, the social media company Chat Away wants to develop a mobile platform version of its web game, Draw It or Lose It! They have requested that the app be distributed to iOS and Google Play stores. The client also wants the app to fall within the allotted budget and be easy to maintain and build upon.  




**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I feel as though I excelled at listing the practicalities of each operating system when it came to designing the application, running it, and hosting servers locally versus the cloud.



**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

In my experience with the design template, I found it really easy to follow the structure of it.  It left plenty of room to know what to research, without actually spelling it out, which is something I really enjoy.


**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

Contrary to what I said previously, I would like to revise my answers to the questions about the differences in each system.  I want to dive more into the speeds of code running on each OS and the differences between the user experience when hosting locally versus the cloud, if there are any.  What are the benefits in terms of features when hosting a server locally versus on the cloud?  I would like to expand upon each point I made overall.



**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I first looked at each consideration and tried to find a solution that handled each client's product requirement.  When I came up with the solution of a web-focused application, I then looked into how much effort it would take to build a single codebase that operates through the web rather than multiple that run on native systems.  It's very important to consider the user's needs in any project because you are not creating a product for yourself but based on another's vision. 



**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

Researching and studying the material based on what others have done with it is the main way I learn.  This may take a while, but this will ultimately ensure that I have taken in all of the knowledge and tricks about utilizing the material.  The Java rest application was no different, as it was completely new to me when I initially started designing the software.  This is the approach I have taken for all my programming projects, personal and professional, and it seems to work well enough.  I think a way I could improve my style is by networking with someone who knows the material I'm researching to bounce ideas off of and make sure I understand said material.
